Notes
----------------------

1. The notebooks are separate because of 2 reasons:
	a) A library for audio splitting requires linux based machines.
	b) YouTube blocks too many download requests at a single time.

   Since the data processing takes too long, we saved the input data 
   in a numpy file for faster and easier loading.

2. dataset.csv file contains audio locations, and the total data size is 
   over 15GB. Hence, we provided the numpy formatted data only. 
   (In the numpy files, Audio data is processed as 1D array and saved)
